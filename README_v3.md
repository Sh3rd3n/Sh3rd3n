I'm a Senior Full Stack Developer based in Turin, Italy, with Sardinian roots and 6+ years of shipping production code. I like building things — always have. Whether it's a SaaS platform, an AI-powered tool, or a side project that scratches an itch, the part I care about is turning an idea into something real that people can use. I did cybersecurity before this (thesis, automotive consulting, CTFs), but building things won.

These days I write TypeScript for a living. SvelteKit is my framework of choice, Bun is my runtime, Tailwind makes things pretty, and Zod makes sure `any` is not a type — because `any` is not a type, it's a cry for help. I pair-program with Claude Code and genuinely believe AI-native development isn't a buzzword. I also do the enterprise stuff when I have to — React, Next.js, Java Spring Boot, Angular, the whole circus. The Venn diagram of "things I enjoy" and "things that pay well" is not a circle, but there's overlap.

I build fast and ship clean — velocity without cutting corners. I care more about whether something works in production than whether the architecture diagram looks clean in Confluence. If you're a startup that moves fast, we'll get along. If you need someone to sit in a 3-hour sprint planning meeting to estimate story points, I'm probably not your guy.

<summary>🤖 The AI Thing — not a phase, mom</summary>

<br>

I'm an AI-native developer, and no, that's not just a LinkedIn headline. I think with AI, not just use it. Claude Code is my pair programmer — not autocomplete, actual pair programming where AI shapes the architecture, not just fills in the blanks. Antigravity is my IDE of choice. I don't add AI to projects as a feature. I build projects where AI is the architecture. There's a difference, and it matters.

<summary>🏄‍♂️ The Other Stuff — because there's life outside the terminal</summary>

<br>

Kitesurfing is the main thing — hence [kitesurfwanderer.com](https://kitesurfwanderer.com). I chase wind and waves whenever screens allow it. Photography, traveling, and occasionally remembering that the world exists outside of VS Code. Sardinian by blood, Turinese by address, restless by default.

I believe the best code comes from developers who occasionally touch grass.
